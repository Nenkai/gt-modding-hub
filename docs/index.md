# Main Page

Welcome to the Gran Turismo Modding Hub! This is a new site created to cover everything about the inner workings of the Gran Turismo series, and serve as a central source of information.

This website is still a work in progress, incase you have anything to suggest, join us on our modding discord!

[![GT Modding Community Discord](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/775896906500538378/widget.png?style=banner2&raw=true)](https://nenkai.github.io/gt-modding-hub/discord/)

## ⚠️ We need your help!

### :material-disc-alert: Missing Builds

There are many game builds that haven't been dumped yet, **including non-demos, retail games from certain regions!**

Specifically, we need these builds if you have them:

* GT5
    * GT5P PSN (NPHA-80025) (Asia)
    * GT5 Academy 2012 (Japan/Asia)

* GT6
    * GT Academy 2013 (Asia)

* GT Sport
    * Closed Beta Version (US/Asia/Japan), if you have entitlement to it and have it installed on an old PS4, we need you to jailbreak it and dump it for preservation!
    * Open Beta (EU/Asia), same as above!

And any other builds we don't have in the [builds](builds/game_builds.md) page!

### :material-download-off-outline: Missing GT5/6 Online Assets

Some online assets from back in the day may be lost to time, but you may be able to fix that! On June 17th, 2023, we managed to recover *12 GB* worth of online GTTV movies from GT5/GT6!

GT5 temporarily stored assets such as Gran Turismo TV movies, museum files and more on the hard drive. Seasonals & GT6 custom tracks can also be recovered if you had replays of them.

If you think you have any of these especially the former, we **urge you to [mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGS_Ryx_7r8) your console** to retrieve these files for archival! 

If you already have a modded console and think you have GT5/GT6 assets, check under the `dev_hdd0/game/<Game Code>/USRDIR/grim2/file/contents` folder if you can find anything there. For replays, simply check ingame.

Contact Nenkai on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Nenkaai) or on Discord (nenkai) if you can help!
