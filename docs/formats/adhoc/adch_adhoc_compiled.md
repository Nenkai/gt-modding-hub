# :material-script: Adhoc Compiled/Header

:octicons-cpu-24: *Applies to GT4, GT5, GTPSP, GT6, GT Sport, GT7* · :material-file-question: Extension: `.adc` · :octicons-arrow-right-16: Endian: Little

This is the main header for [Adhoc Scripts](../../concepts/adhoc/adhoc.md). Most games will have a certain level of backwards compatibility, but it's better to keep them at the latest that the engine supports. This format has changed quite a bit over time.

## Dissasembling

The [GTAdhocToolchain](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocToolchain) can be used to dissasemble compiled `.adc` scripts into an assembly-like text file. Compiled builds can be acquired from the [Actions](https://github.com/Nenkai/GTAdhocToolchain/actions) page, clicking on the latest build, and scrolling to the bottom for a build's executable.

### Symbols

!!! note "String Encoding"
    String encoding is set to EUC-JP for version under 10. You can set it up in C# this way:

    === "C#"

    ``` csharp
    // // May need System.Text.Encoding & System.Text.Encoding.CodePages NuGet packages
    Encoding.RegisterProvider(CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance);

    var encoding = Encoding.GetEncoding("EUC-JP");
    ```

In version 8 and earlier, there is no string table, symbols are just prefixed by a short length.

In version 9 and later, symbols are indexed by an index into the symbol table. Indices are encoded with a variable integer.

#### Variable Ints
Here's a sample on how to read/write them:

=== "Decoding"

    ``` csharp
    public ulong ReadVarInt()
    {
        ulong value = (ulong)ReadByte();
        ulong mask = 0x80;

        while ((value & mask) != 0)
        {
            value = ((value - mask) << 8) | (Read1Byte());
            mask <<= 7;
        }
        return value;
    }
    ```

=== "Encoding"

    ```csharp
    public void WriteVarInt(int value)
    {
        if ((value & 0xFFFFFF80) == 0)
        {
            Write((byte)value);
            return;
        }

        var bytesToWrite = 1;
        uint mask = 0x80;
        long retVal = 0;
        do
        {
            retVal = (retVal + mask) << 8;
            mask <<= 7;
            bytesToWrite++;
        } while ((value & -mask) > 0);

        var finalValue = retVal | value;
        for (var i = bytesToWrite; i > 0; i--)
            Write((byte)(finalValue >> (i - 1) * 8));
    }
    ```
