# :material-go-kart-track: GT4 Course Data

:octicons-cpu-24: *Applies to: GT4, TT, GTHD* · :material-file-question: Extension: **None** :octicons-arrow-right-16: · Endian: Little

!!! tip
    Refer to the [Course Basics](../../concepts/courses/basics.md) for some details about the terms used on this page.

The Course Data file holds all the contents of a track/course. It is split in multiple components making up a track. 

This file is completely loaded into memory, and used in-place. It should not exceed 12mb in size (which is already 1/3 of the PS2's ram on its own!)

## Header

Size: Always a fixed `0x100` block.

!!! note 
    Most offsets can be set to 0 so that a component won't be processed.

    Vision lists can be set to 0, everything will be rendered for the specified component at the expense of framerate.
