# MDL3 / ModelSet3
:octicons-cpu-24: *Applies to: GT5, GTPSP, GT6* · :material-file-question: Extension: `.mdl` / none · :octicons-arrow-left-16: Endian: Big (GT5/GT6) · :octicons-arrow-right-16: Little (GTPSP)

ModelSet3 is a direct upgrade to [MDLS / ModelSet2](mdls_modelset2.md). It still contains models with bytecode to set up which meshes to load and a virtual machine for callbacks. The main upgrade is that meshes now use flexible vertex definitions, bundled shaders and in the case of GT6, tesslated meshes and `PMSH` - packed meshes to save on memory usage.

It is a rather structured, yet complex format.

!!! tip "Commands"
    Commands setup what meshes are linked to a model, but can also directly set RSX parameters (on PS3).

    While PSP and PS3 GTs supports most opcodes, they also have their own (assigned with their unique opcode).

    Refer to [PDTools.Files](https://github.com/Nenkai/PDTools/tree/master/PDTools.Files/Models/ModelSet3/Commands) for the commands.
