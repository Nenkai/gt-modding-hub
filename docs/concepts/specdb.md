# :material-database: SpecDB

The SpecDB is the name of the database that Polyphony Digital uses to store all car specifications, and other critical entities such as courses. Its structure is the same as an ordinary database.

Most tables represent a distinct car part. Some other tables such as `COURSE` defines the courses available in the games.

## Important Information
* Car codes are the car's row ID in `GENERIC_CAR`.
* `label` is what the game uses to identify a car.
* `category` column is the part's upgrade level. It should (not mandatory) match the label suffix (`*_a`, `*_b`, etc).


### Torque Modifiers
`torquemodifier`s determine how much a part increase the torque output of a car in %. 100/1000 is 100%, no changes.

For each table that the game reads the multiplier is applied to the car's value as such `CurrentTorqueMultiplier = (CurrentTorqueMultiplier * TableTorqueMultiplier) / 100`

??? note "Calculation/Conversion Factor (click to expand)"

    From [Azullia](https://github.com/MF42-DZH):

    *"When calculating torque multipliers at a particular RPM, the reverse interpolation (which seems to be linear) is between the first torque point's RPM value and the smaller of the last torque point's RPM value or the rev limiter, naïvely applying just the RPM min/max of the points will create incorrect torque curves for cars whose limiters are lower than their max RPM point (e.g. the Fiat 500F)"*

    "the conversion factor GT3/4 uses for `Power (PS) = (Torque (kgf.m) × RPM) ÷ Factor` seems to be `716.2`, but with GT4 (and maybe 3?) adding a +0.5 PS unconditionally to the displayed power (so the full formula for displayed is `Power (PS) = 0.5 + (Torque (kgf.m) × RPM) ÷ 716.2`, then rounded - either down or to nearest whole)"

### CHASSIS
:material-check: *Applicable to: GT4 and above*

**CHASSIS** defines all the car dimensions, weight, grip and rigidity stats.

??? info "Table (click to expand)"
    |     Column          |  Data Type    | Description
    | --------------------| ------------- | ----------- | 
    `Label`               | String | The human-readable reference name for the part. Matching this to the GENERIC_CAR label isn't mandatory, but keeps things simple.
    `length`              | Byte   | The car's length in mm. Seems to have no effect on car handling, with wheelbase taking precedence.
    `height`              | Byte   | The car's height in mm. Seems to have no effect on car handling.
    `wheelbase`           | Byte   | The distance between the front and rear wheels. A shorter wheelbase will cause exaggerated forward-and-back weight transfer while accelerating and braking, while a longer wheelbase will provide better stability at the cost of worse braking distances and traction due to the car's weight being more centralised.
    `mass`                | Byte   | The car's weight in kg.
    `dlength`             | Byte   | The car's display length in mm, visible in the spec sheet in-game.
    `dheight`             | Byte   | The car's display height in mm, visible in the spec sheet in-game.
    `dmass`               | Byte   | The car's display weight in kg, visible in the spec sheet in-game (before the car is purchased).
    `performanceF`        | Byte   | A grip modifier for the front wheels. A higher performanceF results in improved turning ability, better corner exit traction in FWD's, and reduced tyre wear. A high performanceF (and a low performanceR) will induce oversteer.
    `performanceR`        | Byte   | A grip modifier for the rear wheels. A higher performanceR results in improved mid-corner grip, better corner exit traction in RWD's, and reduced tyre wear. A high performanceR (and a low performanceF) will induce understeer.
    `treadF`              | Byte   | Unknown, seems to have no effect on car handling.
    `treadR`              | Byte   | Unknown, seems to have no effect on car handling.
    `width`               | Byte   | The car's width in mm. Seems to have no effect on car handling.

    `category`            | Byte   | Unused, all cars have it set to 0. 
    `cartype`             | Byte   | Unknown, possibly unused (1 seems to denominate non-production cars, but also includes many production Skyline GT-R's, Lancer Evo's and other newer models).
    `percentageF`         | Byte   | Defines the car's weight distribution, specifically the percentage of the car's weight that rests on the front wheels. A percentageF of 50 means that the car has a balanced 50:50 weight distribution. Weight distribution affects the car's overall handling, traction and tyre wear for both front and rear, depending on whether the car is more front-heavy or rear-heavy.
    `yaw`                 | Byte   | Appears to be a body roll/turning ability modifier that scales based on the car's mass. A low yaw means that the car can turn more fluidly and is more responsive to turn inputs. Yaw is unaffected by placing a ballast on the car.
    `cheight`             | Byte   | The distance between the ground and the floor of the chassis.
    `WheelLayout`         | Byte   | Defines how many wheels the car has (0 = four wheels, 2 = three wheels).
    `GrowInch`            | Byte   | Unknown.
    `TireWidthR`          | Byte   | Unknown.
    `FrontStiffness`      | Byte   | A turning resistance modifier for the front of the car, with higher values resulting in more resistance while turning.
    `RearStiffness`       | Byte   | A turning resistance modifier for the rear of the car, with higher values resulting in more resistance while turning.
    `GasCapacity`         | Byte   | Would define the car's gas capacity, but seems to be unused, all cars have it set to 100 (except cars which can't be used in races with pitting enabled).

    | --------------------| ------------- | ----------- | 
    `Label`               | String | The human-readable reference name for the part. Matching this to the GENERIC_CAR label isn't mandatory, but keeps things simple.
    `Displacement`        | String | The engine's displacement capacity. Formatted as cubic capacity (e.g. `4965cc`) for piston-driven engines, and (cc * rotors) (e.g. `654x2cc`) for rotor-driven engines. Blank/hidden values are `- cc`.
    `EngineType`          | String | The engine's layout, used for dealership stat displays (e.g. `L4` for inline 4, `Boxer6` for flat 6, `Rotor2` for 2-rotor, `V6`,   `V10`, etc. and `-` for blank/hidden).
    `Cam`                 | String | The camshaft/valve type if applicable. Overhead cams and valves are listed as their abbreviation, e.g. `DOHC` or `OHV`. `Rotary` is listed in full, and blank/hidden is `-`.

Twincharged cars are not supported, so cars such as the Lancia Delta S4 are listed as turbo.
    `psrpm`               | String | Display stat. The RPM at which peak power is achieved.
    `torquerpm`           | String | Display stat. The RPM at which peak torque is achieved. As this is a string value, ranges such as `2500-6000` are supported where required (e.g. turbo cars)
    `soundNum`            | UShort | The ID for this engine's sound, mapped to files like `carsound\xxxx\12345`, where xxxx is the folder for normal or turbo engines split by exhaust upgrade level.
    `psvalue`             | Short  | Display stat. The engine's peak mechanical horsepower (PS). Converted to other units in-game depending on region/language  settings. Combines with `psrpm` to produce readouts such as `Power:301HP/5600rpm`.
    `torquevalue`         | Short  | Display stat. The engine's peak torque (kgm*100). Converted to other units in-game depending on region/language settings. Combines     with `torquerpm` to produce readouts such as `Torque:339.22ft.lb/2700-4250rpm`.
    `torque(A through X)` | Short  | Simulation stat. Each lettered column is mapped to a `rpm(A through X)` column to produce this amount of torque (kgm^100) at a given RPM, building the torque curve of the engine (e.g. `torqueE` is the torque produced at `rpmE`).
    `Category`            | Byte   | Unknown.

    `torquepoint`         | Byte   | How many `rpm/torque` points are used to build the torque curve. Maximum of 24 as each only goes from A to X.
    `rpm(A through X)`    | Byte   | RPM values divided by 100 corresponding to `torque(A through X)` values. Can start from any value and jump up in any (or even inconsistent) intervals, but base game cars typically start at 10 or 15 (1000rpm and 1500rpm) and increase in intervals of 5 (500rpm).
    `RedLine`             | Byte   | The RPM at which UI redline starts.
    `MeterScale`          | Byte   | Unknown. All values are set to `0` in GT4.
    `torquevol`           | Byte   | Multiplies the torque of all the torque points (in %)

    `ExtraFinalGearUsage`         | Byte          | Subtracted from `Nshift` to determine which gear the `ExtraFinalGearRatio` is used for. For example,    `ExtraFinalGearUsage` set to `2` and `Nshift` set to `6` means that the ratio specified in `ExtraFinalGearRatio` will apply from 4th gear onwards.
    `LowGearPos`                  | Byte          | Used for rendering the driver animations. Likely related to shift animations, as it appears to only be set to `1`   for convertibles with a manual gearbox and `0` for everything else.
    `ReverseGearPos`              | Byte          | Used for rendering the driver animations. Similar assignments to `LowGearPos`, but has a larger range of possible   values (`0`, `6`, `8`, and `255`).
    `GearPattern`                 | Byte          | Used for rendering the driver animations. Refer to [Gear Pattern Enum](#gear-pattern-enumeration)

### GENERIC_CAR

:material-check: *Applicable to: GT4 and above*

??? info "GT4 Table (click to expand)"
    |     Column                  |  Data Type    | Description
    | ----------------------------| ------------- | ----------- | 
    `Label`                       | String        | The internal name for a car. Used throughout the game engine and Adhoc scripts to refer to a specific car.
    `DefaultParts`                | Int           | The row index for a car's DEFAULT_PARTS entry. Essentially used to actually build a car by assigning it to a bundle     of parts.
    `Price`                       | Int           | How much a car costs to buy. A value of 0 doesn't mark the car as free, but rather flags it as unbuyable. Also used     for internal calculations of sell price and mileage-based price reduction for cars available in the UCD.
    `Year`                        | Short         | The year a car was built. Used for event regulations.
    `RegulationDisplacementFlags` | Short         | Used for event regulations, values/units unknown.
    `Maker`                       | Byte          | The manufacturer of a car. Used for manufacturer-specific event regulations.
    `Category`                    | Byte          | Assigns cars to a certain "type". `0` = `NORMAL`, `1` = `RACING`, `2` = `TUNING`, `3` = `CONCEPT`. Equal or above to `100` is a car that is considered "strange" (e.g. Formula GT, Ford Model T, Nike One) - They have no body/engine/oil degradation and cannot be used in certain parts of the game (`You cannot advance past this point because <car> is a special car.`)
    `GeneralFlags`                | Byte          | Bit-level flags assigning certain characteristics to cars, used in bitwise operations. 
    `ConceptCarType`              | Byte          | Unknown. `Category` is used for concept car event restrictions, and `ConceptCarType` has some strange assignments, such as the Ford Model T being set to `4`. Appears to be completely unused/unread.
    `OpenModel`                   | Byte          | The convertible type of a car. Cars set to `1` have a closed top variant that allows them to enter regular 6-car races. Cars set to `2` do not, and can only enter 2-car races or time trials.
    `NoChangeWheel`               | Bool          | Restricts the ability to buy wheels in GT Auto.
    `NoChangeWing`                | Bool          | Restricts the ability to change wings in GT Auto.
    `SuperchargerOriginally`      | Bool          | Whether or not this car has a supercharger as standard. Likely used in tandem with aspiration flags to restrict entry to NA races.

    ??? info "GenericFlags bits (click to expand)"
        | Bit | Behavior if toggled
        | ----| ---------|
        | `0`   | Makes a car unbuyable (`NotForSell`).
        | `1`   | Hides the last `VARIATION` (colour) entry. Used for special colour cars and the black race cars.
        | `2`   | Makes a car unable to enter races (`RaceForbidden`).
        | `3`   | Hides a car's specs (`HideRealSpec`).
        | `4`   | Marks a car as open top-only, meaning it has no closed roof variant and cannot enter typical races (`OpenCar`).
        | `5`   | Marks a car as a test car, meaning it can only drive on the Nürburgring Nordschleife, Test Course, and Las Vegas drag strip (`TestCar`).

### VARIATION

Variation defines all the colors available for the cars. In GT4, it is also responsible for linking to the model and the color patch. In later games, it has moved to [MODEL_INFO](#model_info).

In GT4, in order to get variation rows you would first need to obtain it from [CAR_VARIATION](#car_variation).
