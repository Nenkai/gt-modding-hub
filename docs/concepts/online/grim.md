# :material-web: Grim

Grim is the name of the server infrastructure that Polyphony Digital has used for GT5 Prologue throughout GT Sport. It has been superseeded by [Vegas](vegas.md) in GT7.

## Grim1

Grim initially debuted in GT5 Prologue. It is a basic server serving [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) content, using [SSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) for it's traffic encryption.

It also supported `libpace` aka DLS, Sony's private library/client for P2P connections/torrents, which was used for serving GTTV contents.

Support for [PDIPFS Online Patches](../../formats/volume/ps3_volume.md) also came out of the box. It is unknown whether it has been used in GT5 Prologue. It has been used for GT6 hotfixes.

## Grim2

The version 2 of grim came with GT5 - not much is known about the changes.

## Grim3

GT Sport brought Grim3 which essentially moved away from XML to use a more popular data exchange format, [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
