# :material-file-cog: Textdata Editing (GT5)

Textdata refers to the `textdata` folder described on the [File Structure](./basics/file_structure.md) page. It is mostly a database for UI defined events, cars, items and more.

However, most of the files are only read **once**. The files are used to build a temporary SQLite database for performance. 

When the game boots for the first time or after an update, you may've seen the `Creating system files...` - this is when XML files are converted and inserted into an SQLite database at `USRDIR/db/system.db`. 

In order to update specific database tables, their version inside each respective [Adhoc](../concepts/adhoc/adhoc.md) scripts under `scripts/gt5/global_status/` must be updated. Otherwise, `system.db` can also be forcefully deleted to trigger GT5 to recreate a database.
