# Models

## Current Status

* Extraction: Not really? Kind of.
* Creating Models: No

##### Extraction

GT5 does not have a tool to extract models from.

GT6 meshes within models can be somewhat extracted using [this tool](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=19919). However not all models are supported. 

##### Creation

Not possible at the moment. Not enough is understood. Meshes can be created, but parameters linked to each model cause issues.
