But what does it mean in practice? Well, consider this basic OpenGL 2.0 example which would rotate a cube around the X axis:</p> C++ (OpenGL)C++ (PDI-GL) <pre><code>glPushMatrix(); # (1)!\n  glRotate(45.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0); # (2)!\n  drawCube();\nglPopMatrix(); # (3)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>glPushMatrix documentation</li> <li>glRotate documentation</li> <li>glPopMatrix documentation</li> </ol> <pre><code>pglPushMatrix();\n  pglRotate(45.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0);\n  drawCube();\npglPopMatrix();\n</code></pre> <p>Observe that the only change was the addition of a <code>p</code> prefix (which self-evidently stands for Polyphony).

Their formats usually map as close to hardware's as possible. In the case of PS2 model sets for instance, vertex buffers are stored in PS2 VIF commands. VIF allows uploading data to VU1 which in short, processes data and uploads graphics to GS. Having commands stored in data allows flexibility as for how to control VIF.</p> <p> </p> A shape. <p>Most frequently the VIF commands are <code>UNPACK</code> commands, which holds packed data (vertex positions, texture coordinates, normals, strip resets &amp; colors) to be transfered to VIF. That data can be packed to take less space (like 3 floats can be reduced into 3 shorts, which saves 6 bytes per vertex!), although this method is mostly only used in GT4.</p> <p>VIF commands also holds GIFtag, which is the primitive way to communicate with the PS2's Graphics Synthesizer and instruct it on how to render certain buffers. In most cases, Triangle Strips are the primary method of transmitting geometry for rendering to the GS.</p> <p>Employing data-driven formats which align with the hardware is an effective means of integrating extensive flexibility.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/11/26/lifting-bonnet-on-gt-models/#models","title":"Models","text":"<p>Models are simply a group of shapes.

(credits Xenn) <p>This uses another callback parameter (<code>1</code> through <code>4</code>) which its result calls a shape and tweens it based on the current aero context (and a bit of randomness).

For the sake of this blog post I will not go into details as for how the bytecode translates into each instruction, so here is the pseudocode for this model and optionally the original instructions, interpreted:</p> PseudocodeVM Opcodes <pre><code>int result;\nresult = (((float)time() / 1000f) + 0.0f) % 1.0f;\nresult *= 1.0f;\n\nout builtin_br0 = (int)result;\nout builtin_tw0 = v1 % 1.0f;\n</code></pre> <pre><code>// int result;\nStackAdvance Advance stack by 1, 1 -&gt; 2, likely making space to 1 variable(s)\n\n// result = (((float)time() / 1000f) + 0.0f) % 1.0f;\nRegisterEval - push stack index: 3 from HostMethod 0 (time) // Note: time is engine provided, values may not be accurate\nToFloat\nPushIntConst - stack index:4, value:1148846080 (1000f)\nFloatDivide - 0 / 1000, stack index now 3\nPushIntConst - stack index:4, value:0 (0f)\nFloatAddition - 0 + 0, stack index now 3\nPushIntConst - stack index:4, value:1065353216 (1f)\nFloatModulus - 0 % 1, stack index now 3\nStackVariablePush - set stack index 2 value to last value of stack (index 3), stack index now 2\n\n// result *= 1.0f;\nStackVariableEval - push value from stack index 2, stack index now 3\nPushIntConst - stack index:4, value:1065353216 (1f)\nFloatMultiply - 0 - 1, stack index now 3\nStackVariablePush - set stack index 2 value to last value of stack (index 3), stack index now 2\n\n// out builtin_br0 = (int)result;\nStackVariableEval - push value from stack index 2, stack index now 3\nToInt\nRegisterAssignPop - OutRegister 1 (builtin_br0) 0 (from stack index: 3), stack index now 2\n\n// out builtin_tw0 = v1 % 1.0f;\nStackVariableEval - push value from stack index 2, stack index now 3\nPushIntConst - stack index:4, value:1065353216 (1f)\nFloatModulus - 0 % 1, stack index now 3\nRegisterAssignPop - OutRegister 0 (builtin_tw0) 0 (from stack index: 3), stack index now 2\n\nReturn\n</code></pre> <p>We can see that the VM returns two registers - <code>builtin_br0</code> and <code>builtin_tw0</code> (likely short for <code>branch</code> and <code>tween</code>). The first is a boolean while the other is a float. These all depend on the current delta time in order to smoothly animate, with <code>1000f</code> being the duration in milliseconds.</p> <p>The following <code>VM_pgluShapeTweenRatio</code> uses <code>builtin_tw0</code> as the angle for the light, while the next <code>VM_Branch</code> uses <code>builtin_br0</code> as a way to determine whether to follow a logic branch to render an additional shape.</p> <p>Obviously there are more operations that can be done using output registers, such as matrix transformations (rotations, translations and more).</p>"},{"location":"blog/2023/11/26/lifting-bonnet-on-gt-models/#victory-lap","title":"Victory Lap","text":"<p>Car models from the sim-racing genre are undoubtedly some of the most complicated given their dynamic requirements\u2014and has led to many creative solutions such as what\u2019s been outlined in this very post.

A shorter wheelbase will cause exaggerated forward-and-back weight transfer while accelerating and braking, while a longer wheelbase will provide better stability at the cost of worse braking distances and traction due to the car's weight being more centralised. <code>mass</code> Byte The car's weight in kg. <code>dlength</code> Byte The car's display length in mm, visible in the spec sheet in-game. <code>dheight</code> Byte The car's display height in mm, visible in the spec sheet in-game. <code>dmass</code> Byte The car's display weight in kg, visible in the spec sheet in-game (before the car is purchased). <code>performanceF</code> Byte A grip modifier for the front wheels. A higher performanceF results in improved turning ability, better corner exit traction in FWD's, and reduced tyre wear. A high performanceF (and a low performanceR) will induce oversteer. <code>performanceR</code> Byte A grip modifier for the rear wheels. A higher performanceR results in improved mid-corner grip, better corner exit traction in RWD's, and reduced tyre wear.

A percentageF of 50 means that the car has a balanced 50:50 weight distribution. Weight distribution affects the car's overall handling, traction and tyre wear for both front and rear, depending on whether the car is more front-heavy or rear-heavy. <code>yaw</code> Byte Appears to be a body roll/turning ability modifier that scales based on the car's mass. A low yaw means that the car can turn more fluidly and is more responsive to turn inputs. Yaw is unaffected by placing a ballast on the car. <code>cheight</code> Byte The distance between the ground and the floor of the chassis. <code>WheelLayout</code> Byte Defines how many wheels the car has (0 = four wheels, 2 = three wheels). <code>GrowInch</code> Byte Unknown. <code>TireWidthR</code> Byte Unknown. <code>FrontStiffness</code> Byte A turning resistance modifier for the front of the car, with higher values resulting in more resistance while turning. <code>RearStiffness</code> Byte A turning resistance modifier for the rear of the car, with higher values resulting in more resistance while turning. <code>GasCapacity</code> Byte Would define the car's gas capacity, but seems to be unused, all cars have it set to 100 (except cars which can't be used in races with pitting enabled)."},{"location":"concepts/specdb/#engine","title":"ENGINE","text":"<p> Applicable to: GT4 and above</p> <p>ENGINE defines all the car engines/parts.</p> Table (click to expand) Column Data Type Description <code>Label</code> String The human-readable reference name for the part.

In GT's case, Adhoc is responsible for almost all of the non-race logic.</p> <p>In general, the game's main executable is really just the game engine, framework, car/graphics handler, etc. It only executes what the adhoc scripts are asking it to do.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>It is important to understand that Adhoc is two different components, the programming language itself named Adhoc, and the bytecode - script interpreter also named and part of Adhoc.</p> <p>Gran Turismo 7 still uses and supports adhoc bytecode, but no longer uses Adhoc as its input source code.

Any tbp field (including mipmap) is remapped at runtime. </p> <p>The GS Transfers are the hard part. </p> <p>But before explaining the transfers, it's important to be familiar with the GS's block/page system,  so refer to Page 161&lt;-&gt;175 of the GS's Users Manual (Docs&amp;Training\\HardwareManuals in PS2 SDK).</p> <p>The important registers to keep in mind are <code>TBP</code> and <code>CBP</code> (in <code>tex0</code>). These are block pointers/offsets.</p> <p>Blocks kinda work as a separate coordinate system. For texture sets, some optimization is made as to where the textures go.  When you have a texture that's for instance <code>350x350</code>, the height and width are raised to the next power of 2, so <code>512x512</code>.  That leaves a space with what's rendered and what isn't, so extra data can be put there, it can be the image's palette, or another texture  So don't be surprised if you see the CBP register of a texture in the middle of what would appear to be the main texture's.</p> <p>Now, for GS transfers.</p> <p>Suppose you have one basic texture with a palette, PDI's builder simply builds two transfers - one with the image data, the other with the palette.  Simple enough, right?  The problem is when larger textures or more than one texture exists within the set.</p> <p>They're swizzled into buffers converted from i.e 4bit/8bit to PSMCT32 (32 bit) so the GS can load them faster.
